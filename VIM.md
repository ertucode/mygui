I want to introduce oil.nvim like directory manipulations to this application. I have already setup @VimEngine.ts . Let's update the array item to be VimEngine.BufferItem for @directory.ts And have the VimEngine.State should be part of the per directory state. User should be able to do the commands. The directory loading should work like this: If the specific directory was loaded and manipulated by user using vim commands, we should not reload from disk and keep the changes. If r is pressed to force reload, and there are vim changes we should prompt the user. @FileBrowserShortcuts.ts @confirmation.tsx . We should show vim state in the @BottomToolbar.tsx . We should not make a separate table for viewing vim state. Just update the columns. While in insert mode the Name column for the specific line should show an input field. We should not update the global state for every input, we should update when the user is finished updating. The selection should work nicely with state. @directorySelection.ts .
