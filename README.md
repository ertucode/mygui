- npm run dev
- npm run build (Build for mac, works after npm run build-vendor is run once)
- npm run build-everything (Build for mac, runs build-vendor and build)
- xattr -cr /Applications/Koda.app (To run built)

- Can't we preview 7z files like zip files?

# TODO

# ???

```
10. Rules & automation

Examples:

“Auto-tag .pdf as document”

“Move screenshots older than 30 days”

“Highlight large files (>1GB)”

Think lite automation, not full scripting.

11. Custom columns

Let users add:

Image dimensions

Video duration

Git status

File owner / permissions

Explorer becomes context-aware.

12. Git awareness (if dev-focused)

Modified / untracked indicators

Diff preview for text files

Branch name in folder

This is 🔥 for developers.
```
